Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

This is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining computer programs, it is about creating softares that work, easy to use and can easily be updated when needed.
    *Saves time and effort when using proper methods and teamwork making software development fast and effective.
    *Growth, good softwares can be updated over time.
    *New technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence have emerged
    *Used everywhere from mobile banking to healthcare systems.
    *Keep software secure by protecting apps and websites from hackers and threats.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  -The birth of software engineering(1968)
   It marked the beginning of software engineering as a dicipline, focusing on structured methods, testing and quality assurance.
  -Rise of structured programming(1970-1980)
    Structured programming introduced clear control statements such as loops and modular designs this reduces errors and improves readability.
    The C language and the waterfall methodologies became popular at that time.
  -Shift to Agile Development(2001)
    This promoted flexibility, collaboration and continued improvement. Agile methods such as Scrum became adopted making software development faster and more customer focused.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall                                                                Agile
 *Uses a linear and sequencial approach                                  *Uses an Iterative and flexible approach
 *Uses a upfront details plans                                           *There is usually continuous planning
 *Uses defined phases such as Implementation-testing-deployment          *Utilization of short splints that have frequent updates
 *End-product is delivered at the end                                    *The product is delivered in small usuable bits.
 *Changes are dificult once development starts                           *Highly flexible and allows changes overtime
The waterfall method is used in development of medical devices and government projects while the Agile method is used in building a mobile app for a startup and an ecommerce platform.
    Waterfall works best for structured projects with fixed requirements, while Agile is ideal for fast-changing and user-driven development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 1. Software Developer
Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software applications.
Debugs fixes issues in the software
Collaborates with designers, testers and other developers.
Develops software based on requirements and design.
Stays updated with new programming technologies and frameworks.

2.Quality Assurance Engineer
Ensures that the software meets quality standards and functions as expected.
Designs test plans, test cases, and test scripts.
Conducts manual and automated testing to find the bugs in the code.
Reports the defects found and works with developers to fix the issues.
Ensures the software is secure, reliable, and is able to performs well.

3.Project Manager
Oversees the entire project to ensure that it is completed on time, within scope, and within the designated budget.
Defines the project goals, the requirements, and timelines to be followed.
Assigns tasks and ensures team members stay on track to be able to meet the deadlines.
Manages communication between stakeholders, developers and testers.
Identifies risks and solves problems to avoid delays in the development of the project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An Integrated Development Environment is a software application that provides tools for writing, debugging, and managing code efficiently in one place.
*They help in coding and auto-completion hence developers are able to code faster with syntax highlighting.
*Debugging & Error Detection by detecting errors in real time.
*Project management by organizing files and libries.
*Built-in compilation and execution which enables one to run and execute code in one place.
Foe example: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Eclipse etc 

A Version Control Systems tracks and manages changes to code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate effectively.
 *Backup and Recovery this prevents loss because they stored in the repository.
 *Version History, it keeps track of code changes to ensure role back to previous versions if needed.
 *Collaboration and teamwork that enables developers to work on the same project.
 *Branching & Merging this enables developers can work on new features in separate branches and merge them into the main project when ready.
For example Git
 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
*Debuggig and Fixing bugs - Bugs cause crushes and unexpected security vulnerabilities.
Solved by using best coding practices and use of automated tests to catch bugs early.

*Managing tight deadlines - tight deadlines makes the developers to be stressed and rush the development process.
This can be solved by using Agile methodologies to break down code into manageable tasks and communicate with the team to make realistic expectations.

*Keeping up with rapidly changing technologies 
solved by dedicating time to learn new skills through courses and webinars.
*Security Risk and cyber threats
Implement security best practices, such as encryption and authentication.
Conduct security audits and penetration testing.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing
Testing individual components for example functions, methods, or modules of a program to verify they work correctly.
This helps to catch bugs early in development.
It makes debugging easier by isolating different parts of code.

Integration Testing 
Testing how different modules or components work together as a group.
Ensures that data flows correctly between different parts of the system.
Detects issues when combining independently developed components.

System Testing
Testing the entire software application as a whole to ensure it meets all requirement.
Verifies the software works in a real-world environment.
Identifies performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and compatibility problems.

Acceptance Testing
 The final phase of testing where the software is validated against business requirements before release.
 Ensures the software meets user expectations and business needs.
Determines if the product is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the process of designing and optimizing prompts to effectively communicate with AI models and achieve desired responses. 
*Enhance Response Quality
Well-crafted prompts lead to more precise and useful AI responses.
*Improves efficiency
Reduces the need for multiple follow-up questions by providing clear instructions.
*Controls AI behaviour and tone
Prompts can shape how AI responds, whether formally, casually, or creatively.
*Minimizes Ambiquity and Bias 
Clear prompts reduce vague or biased AI outputs by specifying intent.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
*Tell me about history.
This is too broad, it lacks focus and has no clear intent.
*Summarize the causes and impact of the Industrial Revolution in Europe.
This is a specific topic and it has clear intent.
